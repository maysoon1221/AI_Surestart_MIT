### Responses

Day 1: I hope to learn Machine Learning and how to use AI to build things like virtual assistants or create models that would help people understand information

Day 2: I learned about the importance of a story, especially ones own story

Day 3: In unsupervised machine learning, we don't know the classifications for anything, but that doesnt mean that the machine can't learn it since cats look similar to each other and dogs look similar (how does the machine know that theirs only 2 classes?) We set hyperparameters telling it to only find 2 of them. Supervised learning means that we already know the classification for some of the data, so w can tell the model before hand which one is which.

Day 4: One real-world problem that could be solved with ML/AI is using it to scan and make sure people entering a store is wearing a mask or complying with the regulations, which allows for employees to get slightly less yelled at by annoying customers that insist they are following the rules (since the employess can show that that a trained computer is the one that flagged them in the first place (data set: https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net)

Day 7: A tensor is a type of multi-dimensional array that helps us do machine learning processes. TensorFlow's tutorial has many different commands that help machine learning and neural networks. All the data need to be standardized or else the results would become skewed

Day 8: *added code*

Day 9: *added code*

Day 10: Machine Learning and AI concepts were utilized in this game very well. In the beginning they had the player choose who to hire and who to reject for a startup company. Later, we had a Machine Learning Model built based on the decisions that the player made. And through this model, we see the acidental bias that the player may have engaged in. A possible bias in a model in real life is the Amazon hiring algorithm. Amazon's hiring algorithm had a bias against women because in the past, more males than females applied, causing the algorithm to favor men over women. One way we can fix this is to randomly cut out data from the men's section until it equals the womens section, then making the genders equal in the eyes of the model.

Day 11: *added code*
