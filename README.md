Day 1: I hope to learn Machine Learning and how to use AI to build things like virtual assistants or create models that would help people understand information

Day 2: I learned about the importance of a story, especially ones own story

Day 3: In unsupervised machine learning, we don't know the classifications for anything, but that doesnt mean that the machine can't learn it since cats look similar to each other and dogs look similar (how does the machine know that theirs only 2 classes?) We set hyperparameters telling it to only find 2 of them. Supervised learning means that we already know the classification for some of the data, so w can tell the model before hand which one is which.

Day 4: One real-world problem that could be solved with ML/AI is using it to scan and make sure people entering a store is wearing a mask or complying with the regulations, which allows for employees to get slightly less yelled at by annoying customers that insist they are following the rules (since the employess can show that that a trained computer is the one that flagged them in the first place (data set: https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net)
